Short Description:
This Shiny app, Air Quality Analysis, provides an interactive platform to explore and analyze the air quality dataset. Users can select a variable (Ozone, Solar, Wind, or Temp) and filter data by month range to view:
Here is the link of my shiny app: https://zainulabideen.shinyapps.io/air_quality_analysis/
Time Series Trends: Visualize daily patterns across months.
Summary Statistics: Calculate key metrics like mean, median, and standard deviation.
Variable Distribution: Display histograms with adjustable bin widths.
Monthly Comparison: Compare variable levels across months using boxplots.
The app also includes a download feature to export the filtered dataset for offline analysis.
Conclusion:
• The air quality analysis project provides valuable insights into the distribution and variation of ozone levels over time, highlighting seasonal trends and specific patterns.
• High ozone concentrations during summer pose potential risks to human health (e.g., respiratory issues) and the environment (e.g., vegetation damage).
• The presence of outliers reflects rare but significant events of elevated ozone, emphasizing the need for proactive monitoring and intervention.
• The project demonstrates the critical role of data visualization and statistical analysis in understanding environmental trends. By identifying seasonal peaks and outliers in ozone levels, this analysis serves as a foundation for addressing air quality challenges and protecting public health and the environment.
